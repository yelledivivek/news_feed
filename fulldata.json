Instead, this one is downed in a bright yellow colour just like this beautiful day. But here’s the thing, for me personally the Ducati Scramblers’ best visual indicator is this yellow paint scheme. And just like this, I fixated on the colour, many have formed a myriad of assumptions after hearing things like the entry point to Ducatis lineup, or the most affordable Ducati. But today we will be going past those assumptions to see what’s the actual story here. So let’s begin.", "Design", "Now in terms of design, not a lot has changed in the new Scrambler in comparison to its predecessor or the model before that. The ethos has remained the same through its generations and that’s only because it works and how. Each element in terms of looks is woven together with perfection. Typically, a Scrambler motorcycle sheds unnecessary elements to be lightweight and hence a good urban vehicle, and on that front, the Ducati Scrambler is a charmer. The paint quality is superior and there are little to no mistakes when it comes to the fit and finish of materials throughout.", "In the new version, a handful of visual changes comes in the form of a new headlight with a ring LED DRL, although we did wish for the main headlight to be LED as well. The motorcycle gets a new set of alloy wheels which is a wise departure from the old design. Also, the exhaust end-can has changed which now fits the motorcycle’s persona perfectly.", "Features", "In terms of features, the new Scrambler has evolved quite a bit as well. For starters, there is a fuel gauge and a gear position indicator now. Both the brake and the clutch lever can be adjusted for reach, which proved to be a handy knick.", "The instrument cluster comes with useful information like range and ambient temperature that can be read when on the move. On halt, this unit also shows a few additional elements in the Settings menu. This includes settings for your DRL, turn indicators and date and time display. Also, the motorcycle will remind you about its service schedule and battery health as well.", "Ergonomics", "It’s a Scrambler and a rather accessible one. The motorcycle gets a low seat and a wide and tall handlebar. The footpegs if I must say is sporty but not aggressive. All this results in a riding posture than won’t get you a pulled this or a torn that even during long commutes.", "The seat, to say the least, is extremely comfortable and the riding triangle while standing up is quite comfortable too. Also sitting and moving the 190-kilo vehicle is not a hassle either considering how low the weight of the motorcycle sits. All in all, city commutes will not be a pain in the back.", "Engine and Performance", "During a typical hot day in your busy city traffic, the Scrambler can prove to be quite cumbersome considering how quickly the air-cooled 803-cc engine starts spitting heat engulfing you in a hot bubble. But a good stretch of the open road and the Scrambler returns to its original personality, pulling away from the signal and leaving a crowd of onlookers staring at the taillight.", "The thick spread of torque that runs throughout its rpm range lets you short shift in the city and also carry speeds as low as 40-50 kmph even in fourth or fifth gear. The clutch is light enough to keep an aching wrist at bay and given its weight, the Scrambler’s low seat height and its sharp steering geometry helps filter through traffic with utmost ease.", "Ride Quality and Braking", "Taking the Scrambler to a nearby hill station on the weekend can be a good idea too considering how forgiving and friendly it behaves on the twisties. The suspension at both ends feels plush during city commutes but maintains its composure while attacking tight corners at high speeds. And in unpredictable Indian roads when a pedestrian appears out of nowhere or a dog that ran across the road without warning, can be out of your worry considering that the Scrambler has a great brake set up with good bite and feedback as well.", "Verdict", "Now, Ducati’s formula for the Scrambler has largely remained untouched since inception. And the new version only reminds us why. Get over its not so intimidating look and forgiving ride, the Scrambler is still the motorcycle that finds a sweet spot between intimidating and enjoyable.

Shoulfd you buy this premium laptop?"], "story": ["The Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED laptop recently debuted in India, and it comes with a 360-degree “ergo-lift\" design. It essentially means that the keyboard gets slightly tilted in the clamshell form for a better typing experience, but users can also use the notebook as a tablet, thanks to the screen’s 360-degree rotation capability. However, the selling point is the OLED display that Asus ZenBooks and VivoBooks are adopting aggressively. The company recently launched the Asus Vivobook 13 Slate OLED, which received a mixed reception in our review. Asus Zenbooks, on the other hand, are Asus’ premium line of productivity-focused laptops, but can the new Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED deliver what it promises? Here’s our breakdown.", "Customers can choose between three storage variants, and the RAM configuration remains standard across the new ZenBook Flip models. The Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED’s price in India starts at Rs 91,990 for the variant with AMD Ryzen 5 5600H CPU + 16GB RAM + 512GB SSD. The middle variant with Ryzen 7 5800H CPU + 16GB RAM + 1TB SSD costs Rs 1,12,990 and the top model with Ryzen 9 5900HX carries a price tag of 1,34,990. We received a review unit with Ryzen 7 5800H processor paired with AMD Radeon GPU. The laptop features a metallic black finish, which is pretty standard across Asus notebooks.", "At this price range, one can even consider purchasing Apple’s M1-powered MacBooks and it’s not an easy road for Asus with Zenbook 14 Flip OLED.", "The new Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED comes with an “ergo-lift\" design that tilts the keyboard mildly to offer a comfortable typing experience. We also get a centrally-aligned trackpad, which I usually like, as it offers more space to rest your palms. The hinge mechanism is solid, and users can smoothly use the notebook in ‘tent-mode’ to watch video content or as a tablet for reading and even gaming.", "In terms of build, the laptop gets an aluminium alloy lid and chassis that is as sturdy as it sounds. To top it up, the device gets US MIL-STD-810 standard to ensure tough durability. Sadly, the lid does not get an anti-fingerprint coating, and it will leave fingerprint smudges. Our packaging included a sleek laptop sleeve to protect from dust. It also ensures easy portability, but the sleeve cannot fit the charging adapter.", "The chiclet keyboard on the laptop provides decent feedback that won’t disappoint customers who spend long hours typing. The power button doubles as a fingerprint scanner for security that was responsive during our review period. There’s no physical shutter for the 720p webcam, but users can use the dedicated hotkey to control its visibility.", "The trackpad on the Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED has a smooth finish with a good amount of travel. A dedicated switch will convert the trackpad into a numb-pad - a good addition for those who spend hours on spreadsheets.", "But the highlight of the Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED is its 14-inch touch-enabled OLED screen with 2.8K (2880 x 1800 pixels) resolution that offers a rich viewing experience. Be it gaming, editing, reading, or watching content - there’s nothing to complain about Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED’s display performance. Users can also increase the refresh rate up to 90Hz from the advanced display settings. Although it is not as smooth as the 120Hz or 144Hz refresh rate screens, you won’t be dissatisfied with the viewing/scrolling experience.", "If I have to nitpick, I’d suggest that the screen with anti-fingerprint coating would have sufficed. To be fair, many touch-enabled laptop screens do not come with this coating, and a handy solution could be Amazon Basic’s Microfiber Cleaning Cloth (pack of six), which costs just Rs 299.", "The last Asus notebook-cum-tablet ", "that we reviewed", " - the Asus Vivobook 13 Slate OLED, did not offer reliable performance due to a sub-standard processor and lack of heat-dissipating vents. The new Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED, on the other hand, delivers highly reliable performance and the dual-fan​ cooling system works efficiently. I mostly used the laptop for work (regular web browsing, watching content) and light photo editing, and the fan noise was hardly audible. Switching between web tabs and multiple folders was smooth - thanks to the AMD Ryzen 7 5800H processor, 16GB of RAM, LPDDR4X RAM, and NVMe PCIe 3.0 SSD storage.", "Using the laptop in different viewing modes was also smooth, and my favourite is the tent mode to watch movies. As expected, the movie-viewing experience was immersive, and the fan noise again remained barely audible. The speakers of Harman Kardon deliver clear audio with hardly any bass.", "In terms of benchmarks, the Asus Asus ZenBook 14 Flip OLED attained 5,249 points which is not bad at all. In the 3D Mark’s Sky Driver test for DirectX 11 graphics hardware, the two-in-one laptop scored 13,069 points. We couldn’t test demanding games due to the short-term availability of the laptop, but it was able to run Asphalt 9 smoothly.", "The keyboard has multiple backlit modes, and the laptop gets stylus support. Asus sent us the Asus Pen Stylus (sold separately), which features a smooth-cylindrical design but it is not as versatile as the Asus Pen 2.0 that I enjoyed using on the Asus Vivobook 13 Slate OLED. Because of the wide grip and smooth finish, the stylus will be sufficient for regular scribbling but don’t expect too much creativity out of it.", "Connectivity options are also standard - we get two USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C ports (support display/power delivery), a single HDMI 2.0b port, a Micro SD card reader, a 3.5mm Combo Audio Jack, and a USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A port. On the wireless side, there’s Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0, which is more than enough for most users. Lastly, there’s also a 720p webcam that is average at best.", "The Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED carries a 63Whr battery that takes roughly 1.5 hours to charge with the bundled 100w adapter. I was getting roughly six to seven hours of battery backup during regular work cycles with 90Hz refresh rate enabled. This could expand if you use the laptop to watch content or reading with light web browsing and standard refresh (60Hz) enabled.", "Sony WF-C500 Review: Mid-Budget TWS Earbuds That Won’t Disappoint", "The Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED is a solid 2-in-1 notebook that offers a great display performance. Paired with decent battery backup, touch support, rotating screen, and noiseless fans (in most use cases) - the laptop is easily worth recommending.", "As always, the pertinent question remains who should go for this costly notebook. For regular customers planning to buy an affordable 2-in-1 notebook with a reliable display, the Dell Inspiron 14 2-in-1 (5410) at roughly Rs 62,000, is a good option to consider.

After the Rampurhat massacre, the Bengal chief minister said that such incidents also happen in BJP-ruled Gujarat. Similarly, the TMC has been talking about the violence of Uttar Pradesh and other states.

The wrong rhetoric is only harming the image of Mamata Banerjee and if she does not realise this now, it will be too late to fix the problem.

", "With the rise in violence and poor response of Mamata Banerjee, the question today is: why will someone not call the situation in Bengal ‘anarchic’ or why will the opposition not ask for President’s rule? Mamata Banerjee must realise that goons do not have any ideology. The goons who were earlier with the Congress and then went to the Left parties are now with the TMC. With the goal of TMC to make “Birodhi Shunno Bangla” (Bengal with zero opposition), the goons have gathered courage to do whatever they want. ", "For example, every other day in the media and on the ground, Birbhum district president of TMC Anubrata Mondal makes inflammatory speeches. Forget about taking action against Mondal, the TMC supremo has recently elevated him to the party’s national working committee. According to media reports, last year Mondal said, “There was a murder in 2011, there was murder in 2014, there was a murder in 2019 and now again there will be a murder in 2021.” The Rampurhat area is part of the Birbhum district, and Mondal is Birbhum TMC president. Just after the incident, he said that the reason behind the fire was fridge burst and nothing else. Mamata is yet silent on such leaders. ", "The situation did not reach this point in one day. Without the direct or indirect indulgence of the top leadership, can the lower-level workers continue such unbridled manipulation and corruption? Secondly, the ruling party’s leaders have learnt from experience that no matter what wrong they do, they face no danger if the party’s umbrella remains intact. ", "CM Mamata Banerjee will also have to accept that the police have miserably failed in their duty. The responsibility ultimately lies with the chief minister. Without blaming the media, the central government, the governor, the opposition, she has to admit first that what has happened in Rampurhat, what is happening across the entire state, is the ultimate failure of the administration.", "The TMC chief will also have to acknowledge that this is a political failure. The party’s top leadership, including Mamata, also bear responsibility if they do not believe they have control over the local leadership. Neglecting such matters is criminal negligence and Mamata being the face of the government and the party will have to take the onus. If the chief minister or her administration had done whatever it took to control the situation, would the situation have reached here today? ", "Violence has no state, no ideology, no caste and no religion. Violence is violence. The people of Bengal checked the aggressive Hindutva push a year back and voted Mamata to power for a third time. People kept their faith in Mamata Banerjee and it is her responsibility to provide safety to every section of Bengal. Anti-incumbency is not always loud.
